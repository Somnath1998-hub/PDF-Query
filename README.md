## Overview

This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with PDF documents through a Language Model (LLM)-powered chatbot. Users can simply upload their PDFs and wait for the application to process them, allowing them to ask questions and receive relevant information from the chatbot.

## Key Technologies and Frameworks

- **Zephyr-7b-beta Model:** The chatbot is powered by the Zephyr-7b-beta model, a series of language models trained to function as useful assistants.

- **ChromaDB (Open-Source Vector Database):** ChromaDB is an AI-native open-source embedding database that facilitates efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings.

- **RAG Framework with Cohere Rerank Technique:** The application utilizes the RAG framework along with the Cohere rerank technique to enhance natural language processing models. This combination provides improved human-machine interactions.

- **Chainlit UI:** The user interface is built using the Chainlit UI framework, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience for users.
